small moments forge deep bonds
those who do not own their past will always be poor
sometimes i'll start a sentence and don't even know where it is going
i'm not superstitious, but i am a little stitious
i chose to have faith, because without that, i have nothing
there's no place like home
magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
just keep swimming
you had me at hello
to infinity and beyond
friends don't lie
if you want justice, you've come to the wrong place
we accept the love we think we deserve
for you, a thousand times over
may the odds be ever in your favor
as if!
why so serious?
bond, james bond.
there's no crying in baseball!
carpe diem. sieze the day, boys.
say hello to my little friend!
hakuna matata
