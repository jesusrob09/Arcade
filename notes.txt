First Meeting Notes

After first impressions, the program works and interacts well with the user. There is room to expand and improve its current work. 

Next steps after this meeting is improve upon feedback and take suggestions. Code will be made more readable through clarity, refactorability, and generality. 

	First Meeting with Professor Davis:
	1/7/2021
		Specific Notes for the code:
			- Preference not to capitalize the first letter of anything if not a Class (In regards to my function names)

			- Explore the with clause, f" strings, try-except

			- Shorten main() by making specific tasks into sub-functions (Ex: printing out to user without interaction and reading in file)

			- Keep functions to a single Task

			- Explore how to improve stick figure animations
				- Blessings tool to edit drawing 
				- Write function with figures in txt file and be read into program

			- Write tests for subfunctions once they have been set to a single task 

		Overall, the main focus after this first meeting will be to improve the code by trying to keep main shorter, keeping functions to a single task, and expand
